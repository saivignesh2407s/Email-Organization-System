# Email Organization System

This project is an automated system that helps in organizing your email inbox by performing the following tasks:
- Classifying emails based on categories such as spam, promotions, and important.
- Automatically deleting spam emails.
- Unsubscribing from spam emails.
- Deleting emails based on predefined conditions, such as date or sender.
  
## Features

- **Email Classification:** Categorizes emails into different types (important, spam, promotional, etc.).
- **Spam Deletion:** Automatically detects and deletes spam emails.
- **Unsubscribe Functionality:** Identifies and unsubscribes from spam or promotional emails.
- **Automated Email Sorting:** Organizes emails based on predefined rules and classifications.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for managing emails effectively.
- **Storing All Files in a Folder**  
     - **Cleaning Folder Names** – Ensures folder names contain only alphanumeric characters.  
     - **Categorizing Attachments Based on File Type** – Organizes files into categories like Images, Documents, Videos, and Others.  

   
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the project.
- **Machine Learning**: Custom email classifiers for spam detection and email categorization.
- **IMAP**: Email protocol used for fetching emails and performing actions.
- **SMTP**: Protocol for managing email sending functions, such as unsubscribing from spam.

## How It Works
1. **Email Classification**: The system fetches your emails via IMAP and applies a machine learning classifier to determine their category.
2. **Spam Deletion**: Identified spam emails are automatically flagged and deleted based on user preferences.
3. **Unsubscribe**: The system scans for subscription emails and can unsubscribe the user from undesired mailing lists.
4. **Custom Deletions**: Emails older than a set date or those from specific senders can be deleted automatically.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more email providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).
- Integrate more sophisticated machine learning models for better email classification.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for configuring email management rules.
